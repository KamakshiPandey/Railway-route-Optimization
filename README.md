# Railway Network Route Management System
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a smart railway route optimization system that enhances train routing efficiency, safety, and reliability. By combining graph algorithms and machine learning models, the system predicts delays, suggests optimal routes, and provides real-time visualization through an interactive dashboard.

The goal is to support railway operators with data-driven decision-making, reduce congestion, and improve the overall passenger travel experience.
